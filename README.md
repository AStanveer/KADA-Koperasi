# KADA-Koperasi
The system design for the proposed online system for KADA Koperasi focuses on
enhancing efficiency, usability, and service delivery through a comprehensive approach.
This new system involves creating logical and physical Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) to
map out processes and data flows, ensuring a thorough understanding of data movement
both conceptually and in practice. The design also includes partitioning the system into
manageable modules, allowing for streamlined development and focused implementation.

To manage data operations effectively, a Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) matrix is
established, outlining all necessary interactions with the systemâ€™s data. An event response
table is compiled to identify potential system events and plan appropriate responses,
ensuring the system's resilience and adaptability. A structure chart is developed to
visualize the hierarchical structure of system components and their relationships,
providing a clear design blueprint.

The system architecture is meticulously detailed, encompassing the required hardware,
software, and network components to support the new platform. Additionally, wireframes
are designed using ***Figma*** to create a user-friendly interface, focusing on input and output designs to
enhance user experience.

This comprehensive system design aims to transition KADA
Koperasi from a manual to a digital system, significantly improving operational
efficiency, streamlining procedures, and enhancing service delivery for members and
stakeholders
